## Overview

Large language models are genuinely useful in the garage — but only when prompted with structure, context, and awareness of their limits. This repository packages that structure as **skills**: curated prompt frameworks, workflows, and guardrails that turn a general-purpose AI assistant into a focused automotive helper.

Each skill defines:

- **What it can do** (capabilities, with honest limitations)
- **How to use it** (recommended workflow and context to provide)
- **Ready-to-use example prompts** you can copy and adapt

The skills are **platform-agnostic**: they work with Claude, ChatGPT, local models, or any capable AI assistant. They are documentation-first — no code required to use them.

## Features

- 🔧 **16 focused skills** covering diagnostics, repair, maintenance, buying, customization, EVs, diesels, classics, fleets, tires, trucks, bodywork, towing, car audio, and motorcycles
- 📋 **Structured workflows** that gather the right vehicle context before advising
- ⚠️ **Safety-first design** — every skill states its limitations and defers safety-critical work appropriately
- 🧩 **Composable** — skills hand off to each other (troubleshoot → diagnose → repair → maintain)
- 🌍 **Platform-agnostic** — usable with any capable AI assistant, no installation required
- 📖 **Beginner-friendly and expert-useful** — workflows scale from first oil change to head gasket jobs
- 🤝 **Contribution-ready** — clear authoring guide and templates for new skills

🇯🇵 **All skills are also available in Japanese** — open the `README.ja.md` in each skill folder, or start from the [Japanese README](./README.ja.md). Japan-specific guides (shaken inspection checklist, market notes) live in [`docs/ja/`](./docs/ja/).

## Installation

No installation is required to read and use the skills — browse [`skills/`](./skills/) or the [website](https://shoka-jp.github.io/automotive-ai-skills/). For deeper integration:

### Claude Code (plugin — recommended)

The repository is a Claude Code plugin marketplace. Inside Claude Code:

```text
/plugin marketplace add shoka-jp/automotive-ai-skills
/plugin install automotive-ai-skills@automotive-ai-skills
```

All 16 skills install as native skills (`SKILL.md` in each skill folder) and trigger automatically when you ask automotive questions.

### OpenAI Codex

`AGENTS.md` is picked up automatically when you run `codex` inside a clone of this repo. For global setup or per-skill slash commands, see the [Codex guide](./integrations/codex.md).

### Read your actual car: obd2-mcp 🔌

These skills are the *knowledge* layer. The companion [**obd2-mcp**](https://github.com/shoka-jp/obd2-mcp) MCP server is the *tool* layer — it lets the AI read real trouble codes, live data, and freeze frames from your car through a cheap ELM327 adapter (a mock vehicle is included, so no hardware is needed to try it):

```bash
claude mcp add obd2 -- npx -y obd2-mcp
```

### Everything else

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shoka-jp/automotive-ai-skills.git
```

- **Claude Projects / Custom GPTs:** paste a skill's README into the project instructions or system prompt — see the [Claude Project template](./integrations/claude-project-template.md).
- **API applications / agent frameworks:** use each skill's `skill.yaml` for routing metadata and the README as the knowledge payload.

## Usage

1. **Pick a skill** that matches your situation (see the table above).
2. **Read its Recommended Workflow** — each skill tells you what context to gather (vehicle details, symptoms, measurements).
3. **Copy an example prompt** and adapt it with your vehicle's details.
4. **Work iteratively.** Report findings back; the workflows are designed as conversations, not one-shot questions.
5. **Respect the limitations section.** Verify safety-critical specs against factory documentation, and defer high-risk work to professionals.

### Quick example

> **You:** My 2015 Honda Civic shows code P0420. Does this always mean the catalytic converter is bad? What should I test before replacing it?
>
> **Assistant:** Not necessarily — P0420 means the catalyst *efficiency test* failed, and the converter is only one possible cause. Before spending $1,000+ on a converter, check: (1) the downstream O2 sensor's response, (2) exhaust leaks ahead of the sensor, (3) stored misfire or fuel-trim codes that could damage the readings... *(continues with a test sequence)*

## Safety Disclaimer

These skills provide general automotive information, **not professional advice**. Vehicle work involves safety-critical systems. Always verify specifications against factory documentation, and defer brake, steering, airbag (SRS), fuel, and high-voltage work to qualified professionals when in doubt.
